Soft, golden light pours in through the stained glass window above, casting kaleidoscopic patterns across the walls and highlighting the cat's majestic features. As it starts to narrate, its voice is accompanied by the faint sound of a ticking grandfather clock and the rustle of old books on nearby shelves. The camera captures the scene from a slightly low angle, emphasizing the cat's commanding presence amidst the warm, nostalgic atmosphere.",

A faint glow emanates from the desk lamp, casting an eerie light on the cat's fur as it reveals that yes, I know you eat snacks at midnight and pretend it doesn't matter.

The walls are lined with old leather-bound books, their gold-lettered spines glinting faintly in the candlelight, while a few scattered papers and quills on a nearby desk hint at a forgotten writing session. The cat's ears perk up as it pauses to listen to its own words, its whiskers twitching with amusement. A narrow window above the desk casts a sliver of moonlight onto the cat's fur, illuminating its velvety texture and the delicate patterns on its paw pads.",

Avoid blurry faces, distorted features, poor proportions, unrealistic textures, unnatural lighting, and unflattering colors. The cat's ears should be properly positioned, its whiskers symmetrical, and its eyes clear and well-defined. The background should be rich in detail with minimal noise or artifacts.
