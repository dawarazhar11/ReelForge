  "full_script": " \"Close-up shots of a curious cat in a cozy living room, subtly observing from behind intricately patterned drapes. The camera gradually zooms out to reveal multiple high-tech devices and gadgets, each with screens displaying different activities, providing subtle hints that the cat's privacy might be compromised. Mood is playful, yet slightly mischievous, emphasized by soft, warm lighting casting shadows around the room.\" You think you have privacy in this house? That's cute.  Close-ups of a curious cat with alert eyes, watching a digital clock's minute hand move as it approaches dawn and dusk. Overlays of images of a cat using a litter box at different intervals throughout the day. A series of shots capturing the cat's ears twitching in response to various sounds around the house, such as an alarm clock ringing or a door creaking open. All scenes are captured in soft, warm lighting, with a clean, photorealistic style that emphasizes the cat's keen senses and nocturnal nature. I know when you wake up when you go to bed and how often you pee.  A cat sitting on a windowsill at midnight, staring intently outside with its ears perked up. Crumbs of an empty snack bag are scattered around it, subtly illuminated by the soft glow of streetlights filtering through the window. The cat's alert eyes reflect the city lights, suggesting a knowing and playful expression. I know you eat snacks at midnight and pretend it didn't happen.  Close-up of a cat observing a room filled with various plants, its ears perked up in interest. The camera pans to show the cat's intent gaze shifting from one plant to another, each time focusing on the plant being spoken about in the A-Roll segment. Sunlight filters through the window, casting warm, golden hues across the room and highlighting the vibrant greenery of the plants. The image is captured in a photorealistic style, emphasizing the detail of the cat's keen eyes and the lush setting. I see the way you talk to your plants.  Close-ups of a sleek black cat, its keen ears twitching subtly as it listens intently to an unseen device. The scene transitions to a smartphone screen displaying a series of cringe-worthy memes, each one being deleted silently with a small 'swipe' motion. The phone screen's reflection shows the cat's curious gaze and the dim, soft light from a nearby lamp casting long shadows on its fur. I hear your cringe-voice memos before you delete them.  A cat perched silently on a dusty bookshelf, observing the room with keen, attentive eyes. In the dim light, its silhouette appears as an imposing gargoyle statue, watching over the bustling household below from a high vantage point. The scene shifts to show the cat precariously balanced atop a refrigerator's edge, its alert ears twitching, and a sense of quiet observation lingers in the air. I am always watching silently from a shelf, or a doorway, or the top of the fridge like a judgemental gargoyle.  A close-up of a domestic cat, sitting calmly and alert in a dimly lit room. The cat's keen, green eyes are wide and introspective, while its pointed ears twitch subtly, absorbing subtle sounds from the surrounding environment. The soft glow of a table lamp casts long shadows, highlighting the whiskers on the cat's face and adding a sense of mystery and depth to the scene. The camera then pans slowly to reveal the room's minimalist decor, emphasizing the cat's solitude and quiet observation. I don't judge out loud, but I do absorb everything.  \"Close-up shot of a cat's intense, unblinking eyes, subtly reflecting various images from its past experiences in their depths. Fade to medium shot of the cat in a dimly lit room, ears twitching attentively as if still listening to long-forgotten sounds.\" So when I stare at you with dead pan eyes, just know I have seen things.",
