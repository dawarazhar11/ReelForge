  "full_script": "Introductory visual for A cat talking about its eyes and ears. You think you have privacy in this house? That's cute. I know when you wake up when you go to bed and how often you pee. Concluding visual for A cat talking about its eyes and ears. I know you eat snacks at midnight and pretend it didn't happen. I see the way you talk to your plants. I hear your cringe-voice memos before you delete them. I am always watching silently from a shelf, or a doorway, or the top of the fridge like a judgemental gargoyle. I don't judge out loud, but I do absorb everything. So when I stare at you with dead pan eyes, just know I have seen things.",
