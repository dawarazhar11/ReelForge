A-ROLL/B-ROLL ENHANCEMENT PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST
================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This document tracks implementation progress for the new A-Roll/B-Roll 
functionality that improves how videos are assembled using a single 
A-Roll file with B-Roll visuals mapped to specific timestamps.

1. DATA STRUCTURE REVISIONS
---------------------------
[ ] Update segment data structure to accurately represent single A-Roll file with timestamps
[ ] Revise B-Roll segment structure to include:
    [ ] Link to timestamp in A-Roll
    [ ] Support for multiple visuals per B-Roll segment
    [ ] Duration controls for each visual
[ ] Create new sequence format that follows the pattern:
    A1 → (B1+A2) → (B2+A3) → (B3+A4)

2. A-ROLL TRANSCRIPTION PAGE UPDATES
------------------------------------
[ ] Implement timeline visualization showing A-Roll with timestamp markers
[ ] Add visual indicators for B-Roll placement along the A-Roll timeline
[ ] Create UI for mapping B-Roll visuals to specific timestamp ranges in A-Roll
[ ] Add controls for B-Roll sub-segmentation (multiple visuals per segment)
[ ] Update B-Roll generation logic to work with timestamps rather than segments
[ ] Implement preview of sequence flow with proper B-Roll/A-Roll mapping

3. B-ROLL MANAGEMENT ENHANCEMENTS
---------------------------------
[ ] Create interface for managing multiple visuals within single B-Roll segment
[ ] Add duration controls for each B-Roll visual
[ ] Implement visual transition options between sub-segments
[ ] Add controls to adjust B-Roll placement on the timeline
[ ] Implement B-Roll preview functionality

4. VIDEO ASSEMBLY LOGIC OVERHAUL
--------------------------------
[ ] Remove existing segment stitching approach
[ ] Implement new assembly algorithm based on A-Roll timestamps and B-Roll mappings
[ ] Create logic for:
    [ ] Starting with first A-Roll section (full video and audio)
    [ ] Overlaying B-Roll visuals with next A-Roll section audio
    [ ] Handling transitions between segments
[ ] Update progress tracking and error handling for new assembly process

5. OLLAMA INTEGRATION FOR B-ROLL PROMPTS
----------------------------------------
[ ] Ensure Ollama-generated prompts align with timestamp-specific content
[ ] Modify prompt generation to reference specific A-Roll content at timestamps
[ ] Update storage format for B-Roll prompts to include timestamp references

6. UI/UX IMPROVEMENTS
--------------------
[ ] Create visual sequence preview showing the full assembly flow
[ ] Add clear visual differentiation between A-Roll and B-Roll sections
[ ] Implement drag-and-drop interface for adjusting B-Roll placement
[ ] Add visual indicators showing the 60/40 split between A-Roll and B-Roll when applicable
[ ] Create comprehensive help system explaining the new workflow

7. TESTING AND VALIDATION
------------------------
[ ] Test with various A-Roll lengths and B-Roll configurations
[ ] Validate correct audio mapping between segments
[ ] Test B-Roll sub-segment handling
[ ] Verify smooth transitions between segments
[ ] Test with different visual types (images, videos)
[ ] Validate Ollama integration functionality

8. DOCUMENTATION AND REFINEMENT
------------------------------
[ ] Update user documentation to explain new workflow
[ ] Create visual guides for timeline and segment mapping
[ ] Document the new assembly sequence with examples
[ ] Add tooltips and in-app guidance for new features
[ ] Implement any refinements based on initial testing

9. FINAL DEPLOYMENT
------------------
[ ] Package all changes into a cohesive update
[ ] Ensure backward compatibility with existing projects where possible
[ ] Create migration path for projects using the old format
[ ] Deploy final version with comprehensive release notes

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
-------------------
Current Implementation Status:
- Basic Ollama integration for generating B-Roll prompts has been implemented
- Initial 60/40 split for A-Roll/B-Roll overlay has been added but needs revision
- Session state variables have been updated to support new functionality

Next Steps:
1. Update the data structures to support timestamp-based mapping
2. Implement the timeline visualization in the A-Roll transcription page
3. Revise the assembly logic to follow the new sequence pattern

Questions/Decisions Needed:
- Decision on how to handle transitions between segments
- Format for storing multiple B-Roll visuals per segment
- UI approach for timeline visualization
